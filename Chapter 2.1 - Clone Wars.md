## Chapter 2.1 - Clone Wars

The movies hinted at clones. This series made me watch them bleed.

The first time I saw The Clone Wars, **I thought I’d just hear blasters in the background while folding laundry.** Instead, I was staring at men in identical helmets who refused to stay identical. They had names. Rivalries. Tattoos and scars and inside jokes. And that’s where the knife twisted. Because once they had faces, once they laughed, every battlefield became unbearable.

**Rex became my anchor.** Not because he’s flashy, but because he’s painfully human. Loyal enough to follow orders, but self-aware enough to hesitate. **You can almost see the fracture forming in his eyes every time “duty” collides with “what’s right.”** Watching Rex felt like watching someone live with a loaded gun pressed against the back of his skull, smiling through it because what else can he do? But my heart was full to see him in rebels. Still alive. Still kicking ass.

Anyway, back to clones and clone wars. **Umbara broke me. That whole arc was suffocating** the fog, the neon light, the way the clones killed and killed without even seeing who they were shooting at. And Krell. A Jedi general treating them like ammunition. Ordering them to march into death just to grind down an enemy. Watching Rex wrestle with duty versus humanity, knowing that disobedience might damn him, but obedience was killing his brothers, **it was like watching morality shatter in real time.** And the clones turning their blasters on each other, manipulated into slaughtering their own, felt like the deepest cruelty the war ever showed me.

**And then Fives. God, Fives.** He should have been the one to change everything. He saw the truth: the chip, the programming buried in their skulls, the murder preloaded into their DNA. He begged anyone to listen. Nobody did. The scene where he dies in Rex’s arms still makes my chest cave in. Rex holding him, powerless, hearing the truth too late. **Fives should have been the savior.** Instead, he became another ghost in Rex’s eyes. Another wound that **made Order 66 inevitable.**

The clones were supposed to be background noise. But now they’re the only thing I hear.
