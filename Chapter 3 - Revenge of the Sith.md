I thought the Jedi would be the center here. Lightsabers, lava, the fall of Anakin, the big stuff. But no, what really got me was how politics rotted everything from the inside.

The Senate is done for by this point. Democracy didn’t get assassinated. It got eroded by convenience. Nobody stood up, nobody questioned enough, everyone just kept handing Palpatine one more “temporary” power, one more emergency clause. He didn’t even need to break a sweat. The Jedi thought they were too good for politics, the Senators thought they were too clever to lose, and meanwhile **a man in a robe rewrote the entire system in broad daylight.**

And then Padme says it. **THE line. “So this is how liberty dies… with thunderous applause.”** The single best line of the trilogy. It stops you cold. Because it’s not just Star Wars anymore. It’s every time people cheer a shortcut, every time institutions get hollowed out while everyone claps politely. It’s chilling because it isn’t fiction. It’s a mirror.

**And here’s the thing: Padme** is glowing, brilliant, and criminally underused. She delivers the line of the trilogy and then the script benches her. Like, thank you George, **I’ll just watch her stare longingly out a window while democracy collapses.** This is a woman who fought tooth and nail in the previous films, who stood up to Palpatine, who carried Naboo and the Republic on her back. And here? She gets sidelined. It’s frustrating, because her perspective was the one I actually needed in this film.

**Anakin** in this movie hurt to watch, but not because of the lava fight. It’s the small moments. The way fear eats him alive. The way he clings to Padmé not out of love but out of panic. The way every choice he makes is desperate, not calculated. **He isn’t seduced by the Dark Side, he’s cornered into it.** And no one, not Obi-Wan, not Yoda, not Padmé, knows how to stop it.

**Obi-Wan**… he’s the loyal friend who finally has to draw the line, and you can see how much he hates it. That duel on Mustafar isn’t about who’s stronger. It’s about heartbreak.

**And Order 66?** I knew it was coming, I even knew how it happens, but watching Jedi after Jedi shot down by soldiers they trusted still made me sick. The clones don’t become villains. They just execute their programming. Which is almost worse. Because **it’s not malice. It’s machinery.**

By the end, Anakin isn’t a villain in a cool mask. He’s just the inevitable result of a system that failed every single person in it. **The politics, the corruption, the slow applause for tyranny. That’s the real story here.** The lightsabers and lava are just fireworks on the funeral pyre.
