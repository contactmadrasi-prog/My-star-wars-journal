**The Prequels**

I didn’t expect to like the politics this much. Honestly thought it would be the most boring part, like filler between lightsaber duels. But no **the politics are the meat.** A Republic so bloated it can’t decide on a single issue without twenty committees and a thousand subclauses. **The Senate feels like every corporate meeting that could’ve been an email, except these emails decide wars.**

And then there’s **Palpatine**. Always in the background, smiling, waiting. Never overreaching. Just letting incompetence do his work for him. Watching him **manipulate systems so patiently** was chilling. You almost want to admire him not for the evil, but for the sheer mastery of process. He never pushes too hard; **he just knows people will hand him the keys out of convenience.**

**The Jedi?** They think they’re above politics. Spoiler: they aren’t. They sit on their moral high ground while the galaxy burns underneath. Detached, clinical, **monks who can fight but can’t feel.** They teach discipline but not humanity. And it’s that blind spot that cracks everything open.

**Which brings me to Anakin.** He’s no mere angsty teen. He’s a boy abandoned by systems and mentors alike. Obi-Wan teaches him discipline, not vulnerability. Padmé loves him but can’t anchor him. And then you see him lash out not as a cartoon villain, but as someone reacting to the traumas no one wants to acknowledge. Every **Tuskens massacre**, **every desperate outburst, becomes disturbingly logical.**

**Padmé is the Cassandra here.** She warns, she sees, she pleads. She’s the pulse of sanity against the machinery of Empire. Watching her idealism crack is heartbreaking. And it’s **not just “tragic love story” stuff, it’s a woman screaming sense into rooms full of men who think they’re too clever to fail.** She knows exactly what’s coming, and nobody listens.

By the end of these first three films, you don’t just see a fall. **You see a system designed to eat itself alive.** A **Republic too slow to matter. **A Jedi Order too proud to adapt.** A boy too scarred to carry their weight. And a man in a cloak who never raised his voice, just waited for everyone else to collapse.

**That’s not space opera fluff. That’s history repeating itself, with better costumes.**
