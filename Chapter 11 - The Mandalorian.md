**Death Watch really threw me for a loop.** One minute they’re these crazy bloodthirsty warriors who live for war, the next they act like a cult that can’t take off their helmets. Like, seriously? All that shouting and baying for blood, and **suddenly no helmet removal is a thing?** That just didn’t sit right with me.

Then there’s **Din Djarin.** Quiet guy, tough as nails, and somehow **manages to look intimidating while wearing a full face mask all the time.** I get it, mystery and all that, but it’s a bit much sometimes.

Kuiil was such a surprise. **The cranky little ‘I have spoken’** with his dry humor and endless patience quickly became one of my favorite parts. He’s the guy who actually keeps all the junk flying and reminds me that every great adventure needs someone who knows how to fix a ship without losing their mind. I was sad when he died for quite a bit. I forgot to watch the speeders.

And let me not forget **Grogu aka baby yoda.** That tiny green ball of cuteness stole every scene with weird gurgling. The Mandalorian nailed mixing a little humor, heart, and some darker moments without it feeling cheesy.

It’s a weird, fun ride in the franchise, a little strange and lovable all at once. Not something I would go back to watch like the clone wars, rebels, or Andor. But it was fun.
