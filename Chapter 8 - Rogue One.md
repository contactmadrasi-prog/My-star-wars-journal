## Chapter 8 - Rogue One

Rogue One landed hard. After the slow burn and quiet grit of Andor, **it arrived with rawness.** This movie stripped away everything and showed the personal cost of rebellion unlike anything else in Star Wars.

**The rebellion here is desperate and messy.** People die without glory or fanfare. Their sacrifices come with no medals or praise. Rogue One focuses on those who make every small act of resistance count, knowing it might be the last.

**Saw Gerrera** stalks through the story like a living warning. His extremism is exhausting and his cruelty unsettling. The scene where he tortures a creature trying to save the last egg was brutal to watch. It revealed **how fighting for the right cause does not make someone immune from becoming monstrous.** There was no sorrow felt for Saw in that moment. His sister’s death, however, carried more weight. It was a clear reminder that loss runs deep in this rebellion.
 
**Bix** did not take the spotlight but stayed vivid. The rebellion is not just grand gestures. Rogue One echoes the pain of Ferrix and the Ghorman massacre from Andor. **The war claims not just heroes but also the small and overlooked.**
