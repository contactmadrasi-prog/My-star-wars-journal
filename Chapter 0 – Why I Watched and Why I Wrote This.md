**It all started with Andor.** Two seasons in, as I watched the Ghormans’ sing and I had tears streaming down my face, I realized **I needed the whole damn franchise.** Every rise, every fall, every quiet rebellion, every gut punch, every tear, every “oh no, they did not just do that” moment. And I needed it in order.

Part of it was nostalgia. As a kid I had **this PC game,** **The Gungan Frontier. You built ecosystems, helped the Gungans thrive**, tinkered with robots, and somehow felt like the all-powerful caretaker of a tiny ridiculous planet. Quiet, weird, simple but it made a galaxy feel alive. Years later, well here I am rambling on the internet.

I had so much to say. Maybe it’s just human to share incoherent thoughts. I figured I’d start small, prequels first, and post a tiny Reddit thing. And then the Internet had to let me know: ***“This is AI-generated!”*** ***Oh wow, no shit, Sherlock.*** Somebody uses GPT, you take all the time in the world to lose your mind on a reddit post. Really? Let me carve it into a stone tablet or print it in a newspaper to make it convenient for your oh! So original mighty mind. Pfft.

Anyway, the real reason I went full marathon mode? **GPT gave me a cute checklist that I could tick. So, I ticked them off, wrote rants in real time, vented, argued with gpt instead of the internet**, cried when Kanan died, laughed at R2D2 and C3PO arguing over a fruit on a random Tuesday, and occasionally screamed at the screen because, yes, some things just make no sense.

Never felt I should share this with the outside world but I decided to **because I really enjoyed the past couple of months. And** well, I was very happy to see some people really connect with the prequel post from politics to the UN analogy. **One even shared a youtube video that made me go, yes! That’s it.** I felt I should do the whole journey. I like it when someone relates to my incoherent, happy rants.

There are four more months to go. Might not have broken a glass ceiling at work or done anything majorly significant, oh! I did finish buy a home. Yay me. Now, I have a huge debt. **Well, 2025 will still be the year of Star Wars.** I might laugh at this absurdly long post years from now, not believing I had the time to write it when the office holds me hostage 14 hours a day and 35 kilometers of commute one way. But I think **I'd like a few witnesses who share my thoughts about a franchise I'm hoping a few love too and agree and disagree with me.**
