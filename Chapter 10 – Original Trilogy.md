Watching the original trilogy last was like stepping into a familiar world with new eyes. **No longer just Luke’s hero journey, it felt like the messy ending to decades of rebellion, political collapse, and sacrifice.**

That moment when **Palpatine** gets thrown down the shaft honestly made me roll my eyes. After all the build-up, it felt too simple, almost rushed. The way his cruelty landed in The Clone Wars, especially with that scene where he throws the cruciatus lightning curse for the first time, made me wish the movies had the same depth. The **animated series showed the real darkness of who he was** much better.

**Leia** in that ridiculous outfit as a slave? It still annoys me. It clashes so hard with everything she became the strong leader, the poised senator. That image sticks out as **outdated and kind of ridiculous** when I think about her character.

**And Solo**. I’ve tried. I really have. But I just don’t like him. Harrison Ford’s cocky smuggler never clicked with me. Lando did but not solo. The origin stories, the spin-offs they haven’t changed my mind.

**Kylo Ren** had flashes of something interesting but never fully landed like the story couldn’t decide if he was villain, anti-hero, or just lost. Have to watch it again. Am yet to tick that box again as a part of the chronological order.

The rewatch of the trilogy felt messy. The story jumped around. The pacing was off. Characters I cared about sometimes felt like caricatures, and plots often repeated themselves. 

**I had to remind myself this story was created decades before** Star Wars became the gritty, layered saga that has Andor that I resonate with now. The original trilogy is iconic for sure, foundational even, but compared to what came later, it sometimes **feels like a simpler fairy tale laid on top of a galaxy that’s a lot darker and more complicated.**
