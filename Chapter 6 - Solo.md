**I hated Solo.** Always have. Not just the movie, but the character too. And yes, that includes Harrison Ford’s Han Solo. The swagger, the cockiness, the **“too cool for school”** vibe, none of it ever landed for me. Watching the origin movie felt like a slog. I didn’t watch it because I was excited. I just sat through it because it was on my checklist. Had to tick the box.

**The movie didn’t give me a reason to care.** It was a tiresome excursion packed with clichés wrapped in Star Wars branding. Han’s cocky grin felt forced, like someone told him he had to be the charming rogue without ever letting him actually earn it. The character just didn’t click for me. He was a smug kid who never grew into the legend he was supposed to be. Lando was fun to watch though.

But here’s a tiny bright spot: I was genuinely happy to see Daenerys in the mix. Emilia Clarke’s turn as Qi’ra gave me something to latch onto. But **Solo was forgettable, unmemorable, and frustrating. But I checked it off my list.**
