## Chapter 13 - Ahsoka

Ahsoka has been my favorite since Clone Wars. The way she trusts Anakin, her gut instincts, her grit it’s always felt real and magnetic.

That said, I didn’t love the Ahsoka series. **The writing felt off, and characters like Hera and Sabine didn’t land for me.** Some of it was jarring enough that I wanted to reach into the screen and **knock some sense into the writing.**

Still, I was happy to see her story continue. Her arc holds weight because of everything she’s been through, not because of the show’s execution. She’s a rare constant in a mess of mixed storytelling.

**And Thrawn?** I completely lost it when I saw him on screen. Had to pause and Google if anyone else thought **he looked like a blue Elon Musk. Glad I wasn’t the only one.**
