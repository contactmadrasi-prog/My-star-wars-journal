A final shoutout to all the droids. I still remember making pink astromechs move around on a desolate planet in some old **Star Wars game I had as a kid.** Swapping their limbs with different parts. It felt silly and simple back then, but looking back, I guess it’s **part of my core memory.**

Honestly, **Star Wars without droids would feel empty.** They’re the ones keeping the whole messy galaxy running while everyone else is busy yelling or fighting.

**R2-D2 and C-3PO** have been there forever. Their constant bickering somehow feels like the most reliable thing in the whole saga. Their endless squabbles are oddly comforting, and their little moments of comic relief? Completely necessary.

**K-2SO** caught me off guard with his sarcasm. Brutally honest with zero filter, he was honestly one of the few characters I actually smiled at when the tension was high.

**SM-33** in Andor was a wild card. Dry humor that cut through all the darkness. They have personality, sometimes better-timed than most humans.

**Chopper**, annoying but cute. **Even Roger Roger**. I think I listened to eight seasons of them.

**And then there’s Huyang**. When he got to say *“In a galaxy far, far away,” my jaw hit the floor.* I had to look him up. **It was David Tennant.** Of course it was. Perfect casting for that dry, deadpan humor.

**Droids, honestly, carry the heart of Star Wars.** They’re funny, loyal, and somehow survive when everything else falls apart. Half the time, they’re the best characters we get. **They deserve their own damn saga.**
