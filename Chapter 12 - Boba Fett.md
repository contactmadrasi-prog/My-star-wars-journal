## Chapter 12 - Boba Fett

GPT told me to finish watching this before Mandalorian season 3. I unwillingly did. The Boba Fett series felt like a **side quest in a bigger story I wasn’t fully invested in**. I kept wondering why Boba Fett deserved a whole show. Back in Clone Wars, he was just a kid running around with bounty hunters. Nothing that really stuck.

**I really liked the sand people though.** Reminded me of fremen in dune. They had this gritty, stubborn survival vibe that felt real in the middle of all the chaos. What happened to them was unfair they didn’t ask to be caught up in someone else’s legacy, yet they ended up paying the price.

The series gave some answers but never quite sold me on its importance. **It was a detour that didn’t add much, at least from my perspective.**
